# Calculator  

A simple and responsive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how to implement a functional calculator with a clean and intuitive user interface. It provides essential arithmetic operations and ensures responsiveness for optimal usability across various devices.  

## Deployment

This project is live and accessible online. You can try it out here: [Calculator](https://calculator66.netlify.app/)

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with ease.  
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
- **Clear Functionality:** Reset the calculator display at any time using the "C" button.  
- **Sequential Operations:** Handle multiple calculations in sequence without refreshing the page.  
- **Error Handling:** Displays error messages for invalid operations like division by zero.  

## Technologies Used  

- **HTML:** Defines the structure and layout of the calculator interface.  
- **CSS:** Adds styling, colors, and responsiveness to the design.  
- **JavaScript:** Implements the core logic for arithmetic operations, input handling, and display updates.  

## How It Works  

1. **Input Numbers:** Click on the calculator buttons to enter numbers. The display updates as you type.  
2. **Select Operations:** Choose an arithmetic operation (e.g., +, -, ร, รท) by clicking the corresponding button.  
3. **View Results:** Click the "=" button to calculate and display the result of your operation.  
4. **Clear Display:** Use the "C" button to reset the display and start a new calculation.  
5. **Handle Errors:** Invalid operations (e.g., division by zero) show appropriate error messages on the display.
